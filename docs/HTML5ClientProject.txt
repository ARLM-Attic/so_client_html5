== Pending for v1 release ==
|| Done |||| Arrange code infrastructure - git repo, HTML, javascript, css artifacts, etc ||
|| Done |||| Arrange basic jQuery Mobile infrastructure ||
|| Done |||| Implement storage login ||
|| Done |||| Implement storage navigation ||
|| Ongoing || Implement look-and-feel [/../pandora/raw-attachment/wiki/UX/Mobile Mike's mobile UX specs] || jQuery Mobile default theme seems closely modeled on iPhone UI ||
|| Ongoing |||| Document the app designs: `docs/AppOverview.txt` ||
|| Done || Include file metadata (type, size, date) in list entries || Subdirectory details will be deferred to [#Backgroundfetching background fetching] ||
|| Done || Implement share rooms || JSON retrieval and content hierarchy navigation working, headers, footers, files, and edit mode of rooms pending ||
|| Done |||| Get all content navigation properly connecting, including traversing between shares and storage ||
|| Done |||| Implement persistent local settings, "remember me" ||
|| Done |||| Implement public shares ||
|| Done || Implement dynamically fabricated popup menus || For public shares item edits, depth path navigation, eventually other stuff ||
|| Done |||| Implement !Edit/Change mode for original and public share collections ||
|| Done || Reconcile entry and navigation between different major activities (storage, personal shares, public shares) || Personal and public share room collections require distinct roots ||
|| Done |||| Add header depth path navigation menu, with logout ||
|| Done |||| Finish headers ||
|| Done |||| Implement footers ||
|| Done || Show item-type icons on content listings, header title, etc || Still need to improve the icon set ||
|| => || Hybridization - Package for mobile device, including settling what exact provisions will be needed for `docs/HTML5ClientAppSameOriginIssues` CORS, stashed user and share credentials, etc. || See `docs/HybridVsPureHTML5.txt` ||
|| - |||| Scope out and implement file-type-specific handling, beyond what the browser does ||
|| - |||| Implement Send-to menu ||

|| Done || Provide an easy way to create app versions with different color schemes || Based on jQm themes, see [../HTML5ClientTechnicalDetails#ManagingtheUITheme managing the UI theme], we can easily tailor the colors, etc. ||
|| Done || Systematically produce various application renditions, varying branding, color scheme, and platform look and feel. || The script tools/prep_release does the job. It identifies the locations of rendition-specific elements, and has configuration variables towards to top for easy incorporation of new elements. ||
|| - || Internationalize || A few stubs are in place, many more will need to be done then cataloging and translating, I guess ||
|| - || Polish. || Reconcile look and feel, different kinds of user feedback and activity timing issues, etc. ||

== Pending for after v1 release ==

|| - || Implement distinct Android theme, autoselect between themes || ... probably css media selector will be useful, here ||
|| - || Prefetching - Implement background fetching of current storage-node contents || [[HTML5ClientProjectNotes#Backgroundfetching]] has some early, possibly outmoded thoughts - the architecture that has been developed provides a lot to make this easy ||
|| - || Implement special UI features, eg storage bar || jQuery UI [http://jqueryui.com/demos/progressbar/ progress bar] ||
|| - |||| Implement persistently stored recently-visited list ||
|| - |||| Evaluate plans for client-based write functionality, what if anything might be done for initial release ||
