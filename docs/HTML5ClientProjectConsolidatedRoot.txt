This is an explanation of the [[HTML5ClientProject]] consolidated root's
purpose, elaborating details mentioned in [[HTML5ClientTechnicalDetails]].

SpiderOak offers a variety of functions, and the relationship between those
functions can be confusing to newcomers, and even to old hands.  In the
process of implementation top-level navigation and login, I came to grips
with one complication and arrived at an arrangement that is simpler than
the existing and designed arrangements.  I think this arrangment to clarify 

The issue concerns the relationship between the list of share rooms
originating from an account of yours with your backup storage, on one hand,
and with access to public share rooms, on the other.

* The fact that you have to login for access to an account's backup
  storage, and to access the list of share rooms originating from that
  account, helps to convey the connection between these two collections.
* The fact that you don't have to login for the list of share rooms that
  your device is publicly visiting helps to convey the distinction from the
  other two.

This login requirement for the first two, and their connection, is obscured
by arrangements where:

1. It is obscured when navigation to the respective collections is separate
   from the login challenge, as it is in the native mobile clients.  This
   separates the relevance of login to the respective collections.  You only
   discover that you can't (or can) visit one of the collections when you
   select it with a footer tab - and then you have to go elsewhere
   (settings) to do the login.

2. Navigation of the respective collections is disjoint - they're in
   separate tabs in the native mobile clients.  This doesn't offer a
   single, comprehensive view of the various content collections, public
   and account-oriented, that are available at any moment.

In the consolidated root I've arranged, when login is necessary, the
sections for the backups storage content and for the list of personally
originated share rooms are replaced by a single login challenge.  When
logged in, the login challenge is replaced by the roots of the account's
respective collections.

The publicly accessed share rooms being visited by the device, on the other
hand, are always visible in the consolidated root, regardless of login
status.  If the device doesn't currently have any public share room visits
ongoing, it shows a big button with a "+" to get to a screen to add some.

Note that the arrangement I've implemented still has separate pages for the
individual sections, to provide places to take administrative actions for
those sections.  Clicking on the section separators in the consolidated
root goes to those separate sections.

These pages don't get in the way.  They are only used for management of or
background info about the collections.  Traversal into the top level
contents of each section - the devices and share rooms - goes to nodes that
have the consolidated root "dashboard" as their parents, so ascending from
them goes to the consolidated root, even if you got to them from one of the
collection-specific pages.

Note also that the sections of the consolidated root could be large, if the
accounts contain many devices or share rooms.  This can be handled by
making the sections collapsible, and having them start in collapsed state.
This would take some finagling, but should be doable.

Overall, this arrangement presents a central, comprehensive view of the
content that is available via SpiderOak, clearly conveying how login status
affects what you can see.  The prior arrangement obscures all of this,
doing nothing to reduce the confusion people have about the variety of
content collections they have available via SpiderOak.  That variety is
useful, and the confusion is not necessary.
