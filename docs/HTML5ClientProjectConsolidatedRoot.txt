This is an explanation of the [[HTML5ClientProject]] consolidated root's
purpose, elaborating details mentioned in [[HTML5ClientTechnicalDetails]].

SpiderOak offers access to your backups storage in a variety of useful
ways.  The variety of content collections - backups storage versus the list
of share rooms available from an account versus the list of share rooms
being publicly visited - can be confusing, unless the app navigation is
clear about what the differences and relationships are between these
collections.

That it's confusing can be hard to see once you understand these
relationships, and take them for granted.  Unfortunately, the organization
of login and navigation in the previous mobile app does nothing to clarify
the relationship.

The HTML5 client is more clear about the division between share-room lists
by segregating resources associated with, and visible to an account in the
My Stuff tab, including the storage content and list of account-originated
share rooms.  This way, nobody is surprised when the list of the account's
original share rooms disappears while not logged in.

Conversely, the list of anyone's share rooms that are explicitly being
visited has its own tab, and remains present (and adjustable) regardless of
login status.

What happens when you add a share room from your account to the roster of
anyone's share rooms being visited by the application?  Then the share room
is listed in both tabs.  The application keeps track of the tab by which
you most recently entered the share room, and uses the most recent tab when
you return to the share room contents from the Recents tab, or to determine
which of the tabs to point back to when returning to the top from the room.
