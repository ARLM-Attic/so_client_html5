This is an explanation of the [[HTML5ClientProject]] consolidated root's
purpose, elaborating details mentioned in [[HTML5ClientTechnicalDetails]].

SpiderOak offers access to your backups storage in a variety of useful
ways.  The variety of content collections - backups storage versus the list
of share rooms available from an account versus the list of share rooms
being publicly visited - can be confusing to new, and even experienced
users, unless the app navigation is clear about what the differences and
relationships are between these collections.

This confusion can be hard to see once you understand these relationships,
if you take them for granted.  Unfortunately, the organization of login and
navigation in the current mobile app does not help, because it does take
that understanding for granted, and does nothing (or worse) to clarify it.

In grappling with organizing the login and navigation for the html5 client,
I came up with a navigation arrangement that clearly conveys, in an
immediate and direct way, what collections are available, both overall and
according to whether or not you are logged in at the moment.

This arrangement is based on clarifying these relationships by organizing
the navigation to convey:

* The fact that you have to login for access to an account's backup
  storage, and to access the list of share rooms originating from that
  account.  This helps to convey the connection between these two
  collections.
* The fact that you don't have to login for the list of share rooms that
  your device is publicly visiting.  This helps to convey the distinction
  from the other two.

This login requirement for the first two, and their connection, is obscured
by the native mobile app's arrangement, in a few ways:

1. It is obscured by the native mobile client because navigation to the
   respective collections is separate from the login challenge.  You
   discover that you can't (or can) visit one of the collections only when
   you select a collection with a footer tab.

2. Navigation into the respective collections is disjoint - they're in
   separate tabs in the native mobile clients.  This doesn't offer a
   single, comprehensive view of the various content collections, public
   and account-oriented, that are available at any moment.

In the consolidated root I've arranged, when login is necessary, the
sections for the backups storage content and for the list of personally
originated share rooms are replaced by a single login challenge.  When
logged in, the login challenge is replaced by the roots of the account's
respective collections.

The publicly accessed share rooms being visited by the device, on the other
hand, are always visible in the consolidated root, regardless of login
status.  If the device doesn't currently have any public share room visits
ongoing, it shows a big button with a "+" to get to a screen to add some.

Note that the arrangement I've implemented still has separate pages for the
individual sections, to provide places to take administrative actions for
those sections.  Clicking on the section separators in the consolidated
root goes to those separate sections.

These pages don't get in the way.  They are only used for management of or
background info about the collections.  Traversal into the top level
contents of each section - the devices and share rooms - goes to nodes that
have the consolidated root "dashboard" as their parents, so ascending from
them goes to the consolidated root, even if you got to them from one of the
collection-specific pages.

Note also that the sections of the consolidated root could be large, if the
accounts contain many devices or share rooms.  This can be handled by
making the sections collapsible, and having them start in collapsed state.
This would take some finagling, but should be doable.

Overall, this arrangement presents a central, comprehensive view of the
content that is available via SpiderOak, clearly conveying how login status
affects what you can see.  The prior arrangement obscures all of this,
doing nothing to reduce the confusion people have about the variety of
content collections they have available via SpiderOak.  That variety is
useful, and the confusion is not necessary.
