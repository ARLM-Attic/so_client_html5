=== Accommodating Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions ===

Contemporary web browsers implement a
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy same-origin security policy]
to restrict abuse of remote web resources by rogue web pages.  This policy
can be an obstacle to applications that have legitimate reasons for
marshaling resources across separate domains.  ([#JSONP (JSONP)] Despite
some assertions to the contrary, the !SpiderOak servers don't actually
enable JSONP circumvention of CORS restrictions.)

While developing the !SpiderOak html5 application, Ken bumped into this
obstacle because he didn't have the luxury of locating the developing code
within the official spideroak.com domain, where the storage servers are
situated (spideroak.com and web-dc2.spideroak.com - both covered by the
spideroak.com domain; the developer sandboxes are on another port, which
constitutes a distinct domain as far as browser security is
concerned). Hence the special browser requirements to exercise the
preliminary app, as it develops.

Hybridizing the application using !PhoneGap resolves this problem.
The !PhoneGap `UIWebView` widget isn't constrained by CORS restrictions.
Instead, !PhoneGap provides a whitelist facility where you identify the
sites from which the app is allowed to share resources.
