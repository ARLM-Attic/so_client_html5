        == What the html5 client can and can't do without hybrid enhancement ==
[[PageOutline]]

Degree to which various necessary [[HTML5ClientProject]]
functionalities are and aren't covered by pure HTML5:

||= Feature =||= Pure HTML5? =||= Comments =||
|| Filesystem access || no || html5 filesystem very limited - does not provide access to user regular files, system files ||
|| Secure storage || no || No reliably secure html5-only local storage. !PhoneGap provides, eg, platform keychain (iOS) and Account Manager (Android) interfaces.  (These native platform facilities are known to be low-strength however.) ||
|| Platform data-encryption APIs || no || For navy.  !PhoneGap also provides access to hardware encryption. (Platform hardware encryption facilities are also known to have wide-spread vulnerabilities.) ||
|| Providing all necessary native UI operations || probably || jQm provides long-press (taphold), swipe, lots more. ||
|| Settings and persistent data || yes || html5 local storage on some recent releases. !PhoneGap transparently generalizes that across versions and platforms.  [#lawnchair Lawnchair] !NoSQL db facility may be useful. ||
|| Offline operation || yes || html5 cache manifest for application code. Will take some thought and design for caching of selected user content. ||
|| Circumventing CORS restrictions || no, but... || we cannot circumvent CORS with just html5 (really, javascript) access without opening ploys that others can use - see [[HTML5ClientAppSameOriginIssues]] ||

== !PhoneGap hybridization facilities ==

Ken's intial expectation of what !PhoneGap does:

  !PhoneGap provides a javascript bridge to native platform facilities,
  often presenting a common API for similar features across platforms.

=== Central Locations ===

* [http://phonegap.com/ PhoneGap.com] provides the free product distribution
* [http://wiki.phonegap.com PhoneGap wiki]
* [http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/ Apache Cordova] is Apache's
  incubator of the !PhoneGap core technologies - Cordova is to !PhoneGap as
  !WebKit is to Chrome and Safari.

=== Central Immediately Relevant Features ===

Here are documented common features of immediate interest (eg, in the
[http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.9.0/index.html V 1.9.0 docs]:

* Events - Native events - I expect this to be needed at least for signaling
  return to the already active app and OS-forced app exit.

* Storage - Web !LocalStorage for all devices - pass-through for devices
  that have !LocalStorage, and full provisions for those that don't.  This
  will be a transparent feature for us - we already use !LocalStorage, and
  can depend on it regardless of platform.

* Notification - OS-mediated background interaction with the user

* File - Eventually useful javascript access to native file system, for
  when we get to sync and backups.

* Security - The !PhoneGap wiki
  [http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/43660891/Security Security page]
  includes a link to a
  [https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iPhone/Keychain iOS keychain plugin].

  Currentness of stuff in the wiki appears to be mixed, at best, so we'll
  need to check for more recent developments, but this is a start.

  According to a note on that page, in the "Application Security" section,
  "cross domain network requests are possible from a !PhoneGap
  application".  I expect that means we will be free of
  [[HTML5ClientAppSameOriginIssues]] restrictions within !PhoneGap.

  It also mentions !PhoneGap provisions for XSS prevention based on
  whitelisting request domains (see "Cross site scripting (XSS)" section),
  and refers to
  [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-Main OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks - 2010],
  a decent list of essential application security concerns to tend.)

== Lawnchair: lightweight db wrapper ==

([=#lawnchair lawnchair]: http://brian.io/lawnchair/ lightweight db wrapper
around html5 !LocalStorage. It provides a db abstraction and a bunch of
local storage adapters, auto-selectable for identical persistent key/value
operation across available storage modes of most browsers we would need to
consider.  We won't need it for platform coverage, but worth keeping in
mind if we come to need more elaborate !NoSQL-style db provisions.
