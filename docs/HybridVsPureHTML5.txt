== What the html5 client can and can't do without hybrid enhancement ==

Expectation of degree to which various necessary [[HTML5ClientProject]]
functionalities are covered by pure HTML5:

||= Feature =||= Pure HTML5? =||= Comments =||
|| Filesystem access || no || html5 filesystem very limited - does not provide access to user regular files, system files ||
|| Secure storage - keychain || no || No reliably secure native html5 local storage||
|| Providing all necessary native UI operations || probably || jQm provides long-press (taphold), swipe, lots more. ||
|| Settings and persistent data || yes || html5 local storage. ([#lawnchair Lawnchair]?) - but no secure storage ||
|| Offline operation || yes || html5 cache manifest ||
|| Circumventing CORS restrictions || no, but || we cannot circumvent CORS with just html5 (really, javascript) access without opening ploys that others can use - see [[HTML5ClientAppSameOriginIssues]] ||

> ([=#lawnchair lawnchair] has a bunch of local storage adapters, for
> identical persistent key/value operation across available storage modes
> of most browsers we would need to consider.)
