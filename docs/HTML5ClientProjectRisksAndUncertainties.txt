== Risks and Uncertainties ==
Identified risks and uncertainties in the HTML5ClientProject

=== Scaling and performance factors ===
Issues:
- DOM and memory footprint
- unanticipated/unfamiliar jQuery and jQuery Mobile issues
- really puny platforms that must be supported

Mitigation:
- Find ways to measure browser memory and other load behaviors
- Be attentive to algorithm choices
- be alert for misbehaviors and reports of trouble.

=== Full settlement of the same-origin issue ===
See [[HTML5ClientAppSameOriginIssues]] for background.

Issues:
- Will !PhoneGap offer enough control? On all platforms?
- What will prevent us from situating markup '''in''' same origin? Maybe
  enterprise will present problems, eg accounts with client enterprise,
  storage at SpiderOak, etc?

Mitigation
- Both approaches are likely to offer avenues to viable solutions.
