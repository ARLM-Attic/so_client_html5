== Risks and Uncertainties ==
=== Scaling and performance factors ===
Issues:
- DOM and memory footprint
- unanticipated/unfamiliar jQuery and jQuery Mobile issues
- really puny platforms that must be supported

Mitigation:
- Be vigilant, to notice the issues when they arise, and deal with them

=== Full settlement of the same-origin issue ===
See [[HTML5ClientAppSameOriginIssues]] for background.

Issues:
- Will !PhoneGap offer enough control? On all platforms?
- What will prevent us from situating markup '''in''' same origin? Maybe
  enterprise will present problems, etc?

Mitigation
- Both approaches are likely to offer avenues to viable solutions.

=== Best approach for implementing addition of share rooms to collection? ===
Issues:
- Reuse storage navigation in special mode
- ... vs implementing special picker

Mitigation:
- Infrastructure for modal navigation is implemented, works for trivial
  case "refresh" button. Should make it easy to reuse storage nav reuse as
  share room picker.
